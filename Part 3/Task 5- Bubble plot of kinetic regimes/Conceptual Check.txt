This bubble plot shows the relationship between mRNA stability (half-life) and transcription rate (alpha).

The x-axis represents half-life.

The y-axis represents alpha (synthesis rate).

Color indicates biological stage.

Bubble size reflects the number of genes in each kinetic category.

The plot highlights that gene expression is regulated by a balance between transcription and RNA stability. Larger bubbles indicate dominant kinetic regimes, while smaller bubbles represent more specialized regulatory programs.

Biologically, it helps identify whether genes are:

Rapid and transient (high alpha, low half-life),

Stable and sustained (low alpha, high half-life),

Or controlled by combined kinetic mechanisms.

Overall, the figure illustrates how different stages adopt distinct gene regulation strategies.
