A stacked barplot is used because the goal is to compare composition (how the total proportion is split across cell types) at each timepoint. It makes it easy to see how the relative contribution of each cell type changes from s00h → s72h, while keeping the total height comparable. Side-by-side bars are better for comparing exact values per cell type, but they make overall composition shifts harder to read quickly.
