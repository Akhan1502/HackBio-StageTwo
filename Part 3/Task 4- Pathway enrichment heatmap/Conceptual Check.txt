Why no clustering here?
To preserve the intended biological/curated pathway order and keep timepoints in chronological order, so you can read changes over time directly.

Why a diverging palette?
Because enrichment values have direction (positive vs negative). Centering at 0 makes increases and decreases equally interpretable.
