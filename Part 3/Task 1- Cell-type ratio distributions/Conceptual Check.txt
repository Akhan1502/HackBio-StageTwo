This figure shows the distribution of new_ratio across different immune cell types using boxplots.
Each boxplot represents:
•	The median (center line)
•	The interquartile range (box)
•	The whiskers showing data spread
•	Outliers highlighted in red
The x-axis displays immune cell types, and the y-axis represents their corresponding new_ratio values. Rotated labels improve readability, and relative scaling ensures consistent comparison across cell populations.
This visualization enables comparison of variability, central tendency, and extreme values across immune cell types.
